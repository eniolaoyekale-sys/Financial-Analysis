Financial Analysis of Personal Spending (Janâ€“Jul 2025)

This project analyzes personal financial transactions between January and July 2025 using R. The goal is to transform raw transaction records into meaningful insights through data cleaning, visualization, anomaly detection, and forecasting.

Key steps in the workflow include:

Data Preparation: Importing Excel records, cleaning missing values, and standardizing transaction fields.

Spending Breakdown: Categorizing transactions (airtime, ATM/POS withdrawals, NIP charges, SMS fees, etc.).

Time-Based Insights: Summarizing daily, weekly, and monthly spending to uncover behavioral patterns.

Anomaly Detection: Applying z-scores to flag abnormal spending spikes.

Visualization: Creating intuitive charts with ggplot2 to highlight spending trends, top categories, and day-of-week behavior.

Income vs. Expenses: Comparing inflows and outflows to track balances.

Forecasting: Using prophet to predict upcoming monthly expenses.

This repository demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to personal finance management, making it easier to monitor spending habits, identify unusual transactions, and plan ahead with data-driven forecasts.
